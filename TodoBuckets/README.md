### About Project:

It's a simple todo app that has bucket system. Bucket is here like projects, first you create a bucket and then you add tasks/todo to this bucket. You can add/edit/delete both bucket and todos/tasks. For database currently I'm using `localStorage`.

#### Tech Stack: `React`, `Redux`, `Bootstrap`.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
